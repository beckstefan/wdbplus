# W. Digitale Bibliothek (wdbplus)

An extensible framework for digital Editions for the [eXist XML database](https://github.com/eXist-db).

This framework still lacks a good name. If you have an idea, please let me know!

## Installation
You need a working instance of eXist (4.0 or later). It is recommended that you use the default software selection 
during installation. The default memory settings usually work very well but you can, of course, always give eXist a
little more RAM.
### Using the .xar package
1. Clone this repo including its submodules (xstring, wdbmeta) 
1. `cd edoc`
1. run `ant`
1. install the `.xar` file created in `edoc/build/` using eXist's dashboard

The app will be installed into `/db/apps/edoc`.

### eXgit
Additionally, it is possible to use [eXgit](https://github.com/dariok/exgit) to clone the current version directly into a running eXist instance.

1. Install eXgit as stated in the repo.
1. create a user `wdb` and a group `wdbusers` for the framework and log in under that name –– CAVEAT: this user, at least for the duration of the installation, **needs to be** in the **dba** group!
1. create the target collection (default would be `/db/apps/edoc`) as this user
1. open eXide from eXist's Dashboard
1. paste:
    ```
    xquery version "3.1";
    
    import module namespace exgit="http://exist-db.org/xquery/exgit" at "java:org.exist.xquery.modules.exgit.Exgit";
    
    let $whereToClone := "/home/user/git/wdbplus"
    let $targetCollection := "/db/apps/edoc"
    
    let $cl := exgit:clone("https://github.com/dariok/wdbplus", $whereToClone)
    let $ie := exgit:import($whereToClone || "/edoc", $targetCollection)
    let $ic := exgit:import($whereToClone || "/edoc/config", "/db/system/config/db/apps")
    ```
1. replace the value of `$whereToClone` with the full target directory on your file system where the app shall be cloned into
1. if you do not want to install into `/db/apps/edoc`, change the value of `$targetCollection` to the full DB path
1. run the script
1. open `post-install.xql` in your target collection
1. if you did not install into `/db/apps/edoc`, change `$targetCollection` accordingly
1. run `post-install.xql` to set rights and index configuration


### manual installation
1. clone this repo including its submodules
1. put folder `edoc` anywhere you want in your eXist; the default would be `/db/apps/edoc`; you can also rename it to your needs (in this case, you have to adjust the paths in the next steps!).
1. import the index configuration files – i.e. the contents of the `config` directory – into `/db/system/config/db/apps` (see the wiki if you change the destination)
1. run `edoc/post-install.xql` to set execution rights and apply the index configuration (if you change the destination, adjust your paths).

## Initial configuration
Set the name for the instance and other settings in `edoc/config.xml` or using the form under `edoc/admin/admin.html`.

## Creating and uploading projects
While many different ways of putting data into the application are possible, the standard way is to have one collection
under data for each project. It is possible to create an initial setup using `admin/admin.html`. The following describes a manual installation and assumes that you work with a standard setup, i.e. have installed the app
into `/db/apps/edoc` and want to put your projects into `/db/apps/edoc/data/yourproject`.

1. create `wdbmeta.xml` in `/db/apps/edoc/data/yourproject`, either by copying, pasting and editing the example below or by using
`admin/admin.html` for the basic settings (it also creates the collection) and adding the other settings.
    ```XML
    <projectMD xmlns="https://github.com/dariok/wdbplus/wdbmeta"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="https://github.com/dariok/wdbplus/wdbmeta https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dariok/wdbmeta/master/wdbmeta.xsd"
      xml:id="yourProjectID">
        <projectID>yourProjectID</projectID>
        <titleData>
            <title>Project Title</title>
        </titleData>
        <files>
            <file path="pathTo.xml" xml:id="xml-id" />
        </files>
        <process target="html">
            <command type="xsl">/db/apps/edoc/resources/xsl/tei-transcript.xsl</command>
        </process>
        <struct label="1722" order="1722">
            <view file="xml-id" label="Title of File" />
        </struct>
    </projectMD>
    ```
    You have to set at least one `process`; the example above points to a standard XSLT provided by wdb+.
1. add project's XML/XSLT etc. files to your projects, e.g. into a subcollection `/db/apps/edoc/data/yourproject/texts`
1. add a `<file>` entry to `wdbmeta.xlm` for each file to be displayed; you MUST give it an `xml:id` which SHOULD be the same as that file’s `/*/@xml:id`
1. The file is now available to view under `http://yourserver:8080/exist/apps/edoc/view.html?id=xml-id`

### Usage and Configuration
Global configuration options, i.e. those that concern options for the whole instance, have to be set in `config.xml` (e.g. the instance's name).
Settings for a project are set in the project's `wdbmeta.xml`.

See the Wiki for details!

### Building the documentation

To build the documentation, set up a virtual environment and install sphinx with `pip`. You only need to this once and it does no harm to your system.
    ```
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements-doc.txt
    ```
To build the documentation, make sure to have your virtual environment enabled.
    ```
    source .env/bin/activate
    ```
Then go to `doc` and simply call
    ```
    make html
    ```
Your newly build documentation is in `doc/_build/html` and you can view it with your favourite browser.
